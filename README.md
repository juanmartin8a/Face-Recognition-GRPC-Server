# Face Recognition GRPC server

This is a GRPC server written in Python that pre-processes images and performs a feed-forward pass on a face recognition neural network to obtain embeddings. GRPC was chosen as it can transfer data efficiently and at a low latency making it very suitable for real-time applications.
